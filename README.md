# SPOKE_NASA

This code shows how to convert fold change data from NASA GeneLab (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) into Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs). 

To run this code you need to download the pre-computed single gene PSEVs (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4404618). WARNING: this is a large directory (24GB zipped / 60GB unzipped).

This code has been archived. However, updated versions of the code and gene PSEVs will be available in the SPOKE_NASA repository.
